# Blockchain Ledger

## Streamlit Application
This application serves the purpose of creating and maintaining a blockhain of ledger of transations.  The information needed to create each entry is the Seller and Buyer name, along with the amount that is changing hands for the transaction.  Once the information has been entered and the transaction added to the ledger, there will be a new line on the chart at the bottomthat shows certain information to maintain anonymity for those involved.  The information displayed is only the transation amount, record, the previous transaction hash, the timestamp of the transation, as well as the nonce of each event.  The screenshots below provide an insight to the functionality of the application.

In the above screenshot, the information for the Sender (Elyssa), the Receiver (Eilleen) and the transaction amount (1) have been added to the text input box.  This transaction has been given a block difficulty of 4 as shown on the slider on the application sidebar.  This occurrence is then appended to the end of the ledger in its proper anonymous format.
